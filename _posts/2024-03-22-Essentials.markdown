## **Essential tools and links**

This page will list out essential tools / websites that I find useful when looking 
at stuff related to crypto markets. Most of this will be familar to anyone who has 
been involved in crypto. However, I will also include some tools that 
are not very popular.

on any new crypto project you discover. These will have all information you need to take 
a first look at the information about the project, important links to their website,
