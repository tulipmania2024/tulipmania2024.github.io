Recently I was looking for some promising low-cap ALTs to buy in preparation 
for the ALT cycle of this bull run. There are many ways to search for such 
projects, this time I chose to go through the members of the 
[Swiss Crypto Valley Association](https://cryptovalley.swiss). It is a organisation 
based in Zug, Switzerland where a lot of crypto based companies, startups and 
service providers are based. In this article, I'll cover the interesting projects 
I found during my search.

First I will list a few projects that do not have token but still are worth looking 
at. Then I'll list the projects that do have a live tradable token, in decending 
order, large to small market cap. I will only explore the projects that have a small 
market cap in detail, because those are the ones that have relatively higher potential 
returns.

## Projects without a token

This section lists the projects/companies that do not have a tradeable token. Feel 
free to skip to section that details projects with a token if you are here just to 
find potential altcoin investements.

#### 1. [Archblock](https://www.archblock.com)
Archblock is an investment platform, that offers on-chain investment opportunites to investors.
It also enable fund managers to offer investment products using their platform, and provides 
services to launch stablecoins. 

Their [investment platform](https://app.archblock.com) is of main interest to me. I think can be safe 
place to store money during the bear market, because it generates annulised yeild of 5 to 15 % through 
safe methods like lending.

#### 2. [Bainox](https://www.bainox.com)
Secure and regulated cloud-mining services. 


#### 3. [Suisse Blockchain Launchpad](https://suisseblockchain.io)
Crypto launchpads is not exactly a new thing. However, this company is creating a 
launchpad for projects/startups that complies with the swiss 
regulations. The launchpad is supposed to go live by end of Q1 2024 so will be 
interesting to the project that will start from here.
